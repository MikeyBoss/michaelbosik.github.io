      <p>At some point after the outbreak, Negan formed a group of survivors he named "the Saviors," one notable member being Simon, with whom Negan formed a firm loyalty, and thus Negan later appointed him as his right-hand man, second-in-command. Negan and his group later discovered an abandoned factory where together they managed to seize control over and took residence inside which Negan later established as his central headquarters as well as his personal home which he titled ‘The Sanctuary’. Over time, however, Negan gradually descended into a vicious, totalitarian leader who asserted his position of authority through forceful dominance and intimidation upon where he fiercely ruled over his community which mainly consisted of thugs and bandits who operated under his command. Throughout the following months, Negan and his group gradually began to grow in size (consisting of over 100 survivors), upon where he appointed several lieutenants, including Wade, Paula, Gavin, Arat, and eventually Dwight; additionally, he established several outposts located throughout Washington D.C. where together they began to terrorize other survivors and communities, and subjugated them to his will.</p>
