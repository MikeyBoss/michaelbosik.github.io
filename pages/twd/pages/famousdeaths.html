<center><p style="padding:20px; font-size:20px">After the RV breaks down, Sophia is seen gathering supplies from abandoned vehicles on the Vehicle Jammed Highway, along with her mother Carol. After noticing a herd coming their way, Rick urges the group to hide under the cars on the highway. Sophia looks at her mother, terrified, as the herd passes through. When she thinks the herd has passed, Sophia attempts to get up, but is given the unwanted attention of two walkers who were still passing through. Terrified, Sophia exits the highway and runs into the nearby woods, the walkers on her tail. She is soon found by Rick, who urges her to stay by a creek while he distracts and kills the zombies. She nods, saying that she will, however when Rick and the rest of the group return, she is nowhere to be found. Later, after learning that walkers are being kept in the barn on Hershel's farm, Shane breaks open the door of barn, where dozens of walkers spill out of. Shane and the group take out the walkers. As the last walker emerges, stumbling out of the barn, the group are stunned and shocked to see that the walker is Sophia. Carol, beyond devastated, tries to run to Sophia, however Daryl stops her. The group look on in shock and sadness as Sophia slowly approaches them. Rick takes lead from Shane, walks up, and shoots a reanimated Sophia in the head, ending her suffering.</p></center>

<center><p style="padding:20px; font-size:20px">Once The Governor arrives at the Prison with his group and the two hostages, Hershel attempts to help Rick in reaching diplomacy. Rick spends several minutes pleading with The Governor, asking him to let Hershel and Michonne go and offering to let his group live in the Prison with the others. The Governor becomes irritated and holds Michonne's katana to Hershel's throat. Rick then looks down at Hershel and Hershel nods his head, as a sign of saying Rick has made the right choice. Rick frantically tries to reason, and reinstates Hershel's virtues of peace and that nobody is "too far gone", and that "we can all come back," leading Hershel to smile vaguely. The Governor begins to put down the sword, but then stops, muttering "liar". The Governor then swings the sword into Hershel's neck, partially decapitating him. This leads to the beginning of a massive gunfight, as Maggie and Beth cry for their father, watching from behind the Prison gates. As Hershel bleeds out and desperately attempts to crawl away in the ensuing gunfight, The Governor catches up to him and repeatedly slashes at Hershel's neck with the sword, utterly decapitating and killing him.</p></center>

Upon realizing that no one is safe around Lizzie due to her inability to perceive the difference between the living and the dead, Carol takes Lizzie out under the ruse of picking flowers for her sister Mika. Believing that Carol was mad at her for an incident involving her pointing a gun at Carol earlier, Lizzie begins to cry, and Carol tells her to "look at the flowers", which was what Mika told Lizzie to do earlier in the episode in order to calm down. An emotionally distraught Carol lifts her gun and fires a fatal shot into the back of Lizzie's head, killing her.</p></center>

Rick gets back up but Joe locks him with his arms then taunts him and says "What the hell you gonna do now, sport?" Rick, in response, bites Joe's throat and rips out his jugular, killing him. He is presumably put down before he reanimates.</p></center>

<center><p style="padding:20px; font-size:20px">While trying to get Maggie to the Hilltop Colony, the group is ambushed by The Saviors and they're forced to line up. Their leader, Negan, taunts them and informs them of the 'new world order.' He tells them he will choose one member of the group to kill in retribution for the Saviors that the group (lead by Rick) had killed (as well as the Saviors that Daryl killed). Negan cruelly chooses Abraham after a final random selection, bashing his head with his baseball bat wrapped in barbed wire, which he nicknames "Lucille", but not before discreetly flashing Sasha a peace sign aware of his fate.

Abraham manages to survive the first of Negan's blows and he manages to muster his last words, "Suck... my... nuts." before he eventually succumbs to another violent strike on the head. Negan continues beating Abraham until there is nothing recognizable left of him. After Negan taunts Rosita following Abraham's brutal death, Daryl gets up and attempts to attack Negan, punching him once. After Daryl is subdued, Negan expresses his disapproval of such behavior to Rick's group. However, Negan spares Daryl and instead makes an example of Glenn, bashing his head in with Lucille. Glenn manages to survive the first two blows, causing horrific damage, crushing his skull which caused one of his eyes to pop out. He manages to muster his last words, "Maggie, I'll -- I'll find you." before he eventually succumbs to another violent strike on the face. Negan continues beating Glenn until there is nothing recognizable left of his head, killing him in the same fashion as Abraham.</p></center>
