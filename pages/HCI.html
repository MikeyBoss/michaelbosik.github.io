                            <h3><strong>Conceptualize</strong></h3>
                            <p>When starting a design process, one of my principles that I follow is to come up with as many ideas as possible. In order to create a product that is malleable and extensive in design, it must contain a lot of features and have extensive functionality. This is the quantity over quality approach. This method sticks with me from a story that I read. As the story goes, an art professor assigned his students to make a pot while dividing the assignment between the halves of the class. One half was to create as many pots as possible and will be graded on the overall quality of the many pots they made. The other half was to create one, completely perfect pot with careful design and planning gone into it. The story reveals that the half of the class that had to turn in more pots ended up getting the better grade, because they were able to practice and learn from their mistakes. The half of the class that made the carefully planned pot ended up overestimating their ability and could not make a pot as good as they imagined.</p>

                            <h3><strong>Be Logical</strong></h3>
                            <p>A perfect point that this story brings up is that, when designing something, you must maintain the mindset of what is actually logistically plausible. Going into a big project can be exciting. From personal experience, I have noticed that the ideas I come up with for the different aspects of the product may not exactly be reasonably accomplishable for the timeframe between then and the due date. From this, I’ve learned that it is always good to stay on top of progress and when to cut certain ideas from the design. Even though myself or one of my team members would be able to make the idea come to life in a given time, they might not be able to work as fast as the assignment requires.</p>

                            <h3><strong>Set Deadlines</strong></h3>
                            <p>This leads into my next point: deadlines. When a project is started, there is typically a time that is set for the project to be done, or at least to have a working prototype ready for testing. Because of this, it is always good to make sure that the group and yourself are following a strict schedule. This is necessary to follow the point of following logistics and to make sure that the prototype ends up actually being finished on time. It helps to break up the work day by day and to make sure everyone understands what exactly needs to get done, when it needs to get done by, and who needs to do it.</p>

                            <h3><strong>Testing</strong></h3>
                            <p>After the prototype is finished and functional, it should be ready for testing. Something that I have learned is to get as much user testing as possible when coming up with a product. When a user is able to give feedback on the prototype, they could let you and your team become aware of any flaws in the design that you may have missed. From there, you could improve the design and test again to make sure it stays up to par with user interaction. This is imperative to the design process because if a user cannot use your product properly, it will not be used by the user.</p>

                            <h3><strong>Smooth Out Design</strong></h3>
                            <p>One of my favorite parts of the design process is to smooth out the rough edges of a prototype. Although a prototype is basically a rough draft of the final product and will have many un smoothed areas and loose ends, user testing will always point out where to improve. The smoothing process allows for the prototype to basically evolve into its better self. This is where design, for me, becomes interesting - to see the growth of a product from start to finish. </p>

                                The Worcester Public Library’s mobile website is very difficult to navigate. With white on grey text, and non working hyperlinks, trying to find what you are looking for is a hassle. If you’re a teenager, looking for help in your college planning process, whether it be SAT prep or scholarship searching, the library’s website should be the number one place to look. Our design was meant to make the WPL website, not only easy to use for that purpose, but informative about what the user is doing as well. The homepage consists of the most common things a teenager might look for when going to a library’s website: Volunteering, Scholarships, College Planning, and SAT/ACT prep. Along with these hyperlinks, there are short yet informative descriptions of each aspect of college preparation.

                               This project was to have us take a set of data and create visualisations of it in ways we saw fit. After sifting through data sets and discussing the possibilities of exploring each, we decided on the analyzing the data provided by FiveThirtyEight on college majors. The data provided was a comprehensive set of college majors, gender makeup, salaries, employment rates, and various other data points. We split up to display the data from as clearly as possible and to create a visualization to leveraged the data to convince our audience of something. Our visualizations were created with a diverse tech stack that included Vega, R, Java, and D3.js.

At the same time, others might say that school uniforms promote conformity which is a necessary aspect of a child’s learning environment.

We made a website which shows users memes to make them laugh, but also has built-in “brackets”, so that at the end of the process, there is a favourite meme of the user. This would enable us to stick with the meme idea, but incorporate some facets of a game to make it more fun for the user!</p>

Using the A-frame libraries and programming in a simple html file, we were able to construct a virtual environment replicating our Solar System. A-Frame is an open-source web framework for building virtual reality experiences, and is primarily maintained by Mozilla and the WebVR community. It’s extensive libraries allow you to create shapes and text that can move, change appearance, respond to user input and much more, all in your web browser. In our environment, we were able to include multiple differently sized spheres as all of the planets, and texture and space them accordingly. The purpose of this project was to introduce young children to an interactive model of the universe.
